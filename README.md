# Analog-Clock
This is a digital simulation of an Analog Clock created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.The clock shows the current time with rotating hands for hours, minutes, and seconds, providing a smooth and visually appealing design with custom animations and gradients.


## Features

- **Real-Time Analog Display**: The clock hands rotate based on the real-time system clock.
- **Smooth Animations**: The hour, minute, and second hands rotate smoothly to reflect the time.
- **Gradient Background**: The clock has a radial gradient background that provides a modern and attractive look.
- **Responsive Layout**: The clock is centered and adapts to various screen sizes for optimal display.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the analog clock with clock hands and numbers.
- **CSS**: Styling the clock, numbers, background, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for dynamically updating the clock hands according to the current time.

## How It Works

1. The clock uses JavaScript's `Date` object to retrieve the current time.
2. The hands (hour, minute, and second) are rotated based on the current time using CSS `transform` properties.
3. The `setInterval` method is used to update the hands every second.
4. CSS provides the styling, including the clock face, gradient background, and glowing number effects.
